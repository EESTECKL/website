 <h3>Event Info:</h3>
            <p align="justify">Shaped By Imagination (SBI) is a two days embedded systems workshop and competition. 
                During this event, students will have a chance to work with the Lego robots.</p>

            <br/><br/>
            <p align="justify">During the studies, students often have many courses related to programming, embedded systems development and etc. Of course, it is important to have a solid theoretical background about the topic, but things in practice often work differently. Therefore, we have come up with the idea about organizing an embedded workshop where students would put their theoretical knowledge to the test. With help of the department for Real Time Systems (RTS) we will set up a laboratory. Event is split in two phases. In first phase, students will have a learning session where they will get their hands on the robotic platform and get a better understanding of its hardware and software. We will be working with a Lego Mindstorms NXT robots. These robots have three servos. For communication with the outer world, available are touch, ambient light and sound level sensor. For navigation, available are ultrasonic distance measurement sensor and gyroscope. Software platform, to be used, is NXTosek based on C++. </p>
            <p align="justify">Therefore, event will consider significant amount of learning. Our focus is not on explaining how each of these sensors is working, but rather how they can be coupled together. That is also the case with the software. We will not be teaching basics of C++, but more specifics of NXTosek and how it is used to program the robots.</p>
            <p align="justify">After students are introduced to the platform, they will proceed to the competition phase. Students will be divided into several groups and have a chance to experience teamwork. Every group will receive identical task and have a certain deadline within which it must complete it. Members of team, with the best solution, will receive prizes.</p>

                 <h3>Competition:</h3>
                 <p align="justify">Core part of the event is the competition. All teams will receive a robot and a task which robot must perform. Arena for the competition will be set up in the laboratory. Our technical team is working on the details of the competition. After all teams present their work, our members together with the help of the professor from RTS department will choose the best solution. Winning team members will receive a prizes and certificates for their success. All participants will receive certificates for their participation in the competition. With this competition, we are trying to inspire students to take an active role in solving real world challenges.</p>
