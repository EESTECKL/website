 <h3>Event Info:</h3>
 <p align="justify">International nights are regularly organized in IntClub. However, only foreign communities with more students are able to organize such events. Further, on the international nights, so far, we could only feel the spirit and taste dishes of one culture. Some were good, some event better and now it is time to compare them. 
                        <br/><br/>
International Nite:  Taste me before you judge me (INT) aims to allow presentation of culture of countries with only few students present in Kaiserslautern. It has few categories and as a competitor, you can choose your category and not berate yourselves too much. You can specify traditional song (link from YouTube) which will be played during the night. Of course, bigger teams can compete in more categories. From one country, we can have several teams.
<br/><br/>
This competition of students from different countries in various meal's categories aims to demonstrate how each culture has something to be proud of. In world full of often negative prejudices we want to associate country with taste. Next time you hear about this country far away let the first thing that you think of be sweet, spicy or simply the most amazing thing I have ever tasted.
<br/><br/>
Talk with your friends, register on our website, prepare a meal and enter the race. If you are just a visitor, be ready to taste great variety of dishes and give an honest feedback on it. If you have any questions, please contact us on eestec@rhrk.uni-kl.de.
<br/><br/>
Welcome and enjoy in wonderful evening.</p>
