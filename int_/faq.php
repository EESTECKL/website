                <h3>For competitors:</h3>
			<h4>Who are competitors?</h4>
                        <p>They are teams of people which will make dishes and compete.</p>
                        <h4>What should I do to participate in competition?</h4>
                        <p>Register on our website. Prepare the meal(s) and come to the international night.</p>
                        
                        <h4>For how many people we need to cook?</h4>
                        <p>The competition is about demonstrating meals of various countries. Hence many people will be cooking food, allowing visitors to taste a little from every competitor. We suggest you to cook food that is enough for 4-6 people. But if you are cooking something that can only be served in pieces (e.g. cookies) than you could make them for more people.</p>
                        <h4>Is the food we prepare sponsored by organizers?</h4>
                        <p>Unfortunately organizers will not be sponsoring the food.</p>
                        <h4>How many food items one group can prepare?</h4>
                        <p>One group can prepare as many items as they want to. Each will be evaluated separately.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h4>Who from the team should do the registration?</h4>
                        <p>Person who is the most likely to reply on emails should register, since we will send additional information.</p>
                        <h4>What is the maximum number of people in one team?</h4>
                        <p>Up to 7 persons can be in one team.</p>
                        <h4>What is the minimum number of people in one team?</h4>
                        <p>Only 1 person is enough for a team.</p>
                        <h4>Can we have more than one team from the same country?</h4>
                        <p>Yes.</p>
                        <h4>When should we come to IntClub?</h4>
                        <p>About exact time, you will be notified via email.</p>
                        <h4>Can I bring additional cultural symbols (flag, traditional clothes, etc.) to the event?</h4>
                        <p>All traditional elements are more than welcome, the more the better.</p>
                        <h4>Who will make decision about winners?</h4>
                        <p>Visitors of the evening with their votes will choose best from each category.</p>

                <h3>For visitors:</h3>
			<h4>Who are visitors?</h4>
                        <p>All persons who want to come and enjoy in variety of different meals.</p>
                        <h4>As a visitor, should I bring something?</h4>
                        <p>Just a positive spirit. If you want, you can wear your traditional outfit.</p>
                        <h4>What is expected from me as a visitor?</h4>
