 <h3>Event Info:</h3>

            <br/><br/>
            <p align="justify">International day of peace has been established in 1981, by United Nations General Assembly. Chosen date was the third Tuesday of September, and on the Tuesday 21 September 1982 was the first occurrence of the International Day of Peace. In 2001 the opening day of the General Assembly was scheduled for 11 September, and Secretary General Kofi Annan drafted a message recognising the observance of International Peace Day on 12 September [7]. That year the day was changed from the third Tuesday to specifically the twenty-first day of September, to take effect in 2002. Since then, this date is celebrated in the hold world and current efforts are to make it a day of ceasefire. Peace One Day’s objective is to institutionalise Peace Day 21 September, making it a day that is self-sustaining, an annual day of global unity, a day of intercultural cooperation on a scale that humanity has never known.</p>
