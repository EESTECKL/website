 <h3>Event Info:</h3>
            <p align="justify">Imagine.Create.Enthral is a two days game development workshop and competition. During this event, students will have a chance to learn and work with the Unity game engine.</p>

            <p align="justify">During the studies, students often have many courses related to programming and software development but they often don’t get chance to implement the skill they have acquired. Also, gaming be it on computer, consoles or on mobile phones is very popular amongst students.  Therefore, we have come up with the idea about organizing an event on Gaming engine.This event will allow the students to improve their software skills by doing something they will enjoy. The event is split in two phases: In first phase, students will be taught to build a game using the a Gaming engine called “Unity” and get a better understanding of the game development cycle. Unity is a game development ecosystem: a powerful rendering engine fully integrated with a complete set of intuitive tools and rapid workflows to create interactive 3D and 2D content; easy multiplatform publishing; thousands of quality, ready-made assets in the Asset Store and a knowledge-sharing community. It is used to develop video games for web sites, desktop platforms, consoles, and mobile devices. First announced only for Mac OS, at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in 2005, it has since been extended to target more than fifteen platforms. It is now the default software development kit (SDK) for the Nintendo Wii U. With an emphasis on portability, the graphics engine targets the following APIs: Direct3D on Windows and Xbox 360; OpenGL on Mac, Windows, and Linux; OpenGL ES on Android and iOS; and proprietary APIs on video game consoles. For independent developers and studios, Unity’s democratizing ecosystem smashes the time and cost barriers to creating uniquely beautiful games. They are using Unity to build a livelihood doing what they love: creating games that hook and delight players on any platform.</p>

                 <h3>Competition:</h3>
                 <p align="justify">After students are introduced to the game engine, they will proceed to the second phase: competition. Students will be divided into several groups and have a chance to experience teamwork. Every group will be asked to create a simple game and have a certain deadline within which it must complete it. Members of team with the best game design will receive prizes. This event will be completely organized by members of EESTEC Observer Kaiserslautern with support help from professors of TU Kaiserslautern.
